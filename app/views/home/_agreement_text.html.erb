        Echo Market is offered as a facilitating service to introduce borrowers seeking to lenders offering EchoMarket approved items.</p>
      <p >
        Once a borrower or lender has been introduced, EchoMarket will play no mediating role in that event, except in the case of anonymous item donations.
      </p>

      <p >
        In the aftermath of that event, EchoMarket will offer a 'Satisfaction Survey' to either the borrower and the lender, as appropriate.
        If satisfaction is found lacking, EchoMarket will then seek more information to determine the cause of dissatisfaction and/or the continuation of either the borrower or lender participation.
